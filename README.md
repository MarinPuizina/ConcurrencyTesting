# ConcurrencyTesting

Learning about concurrency in Java. The code samples will consist mostly of ideas from the book "Java Concurrency in Practice" 
by Brian Goetz as I read through it. Also, I will add code samples from ideas that I have found from other sources and that 
I have came up by myself.

ThreadInterrupt --> One of the examples of how to interrupt a thread.   
CancellingTaskUsingFuture -- > Using Future to cancel task if it is not finished.   
ExecutorShutdown --> Preferred way to shutdown executors.
